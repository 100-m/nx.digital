A phase will start if and only if all conditions are Verified

A sprint is a period of time (5 days) during which specific work has to be completed and made ready for review

Definition of Done: What is expected during this phase

2 dedicated moments will be allowed for FeedBacks:
  -> ROUND1: End of phase 2 (Complementary data)

## Definition of done :
  -> The customer can access slack and Trello
  -> Main fund profiles identified

# 2) Referential and custodian data

## Definition of ready:

  -> nx_pack:
      -> asset referential with at least (Currency, Asset_Class, Country, Sector)
      -> Fund referential
      -> translation for at least 1 language
  -> Custudian data:

## Sprint
During this phase developper will:
  -> Process custodian data and referential data
  -> Deploy Application and enable daily update

## Definition of done :
