## Prerequisite
Having a demo_template placed in the templates section.


### Definition:
A template is a specific design used for the creation of a report. You can have different templates in your dashboard. Once created, it can be used for reports creation.

### Step 1 - Go to Client Edition > Templates tab
On client edition, go to Templates tab. You will find a list of fact-sheet templates. Some might appear inaccessible (in grey); it means you cannot modify it as it was built by NeoXam.

On the right, you have:
- Preview (eye icon)
- Edit (pen icon)
- Duplicate (file icon)
- Delete (trash icon)

### Step 2 – Create and delete a template
In this step, you will create, then delete a template. We will go with the demo_template for next steps.
- Click on “Create PDF” or “Create PDF” button
- Name your new template and confirm
- The new template appears in the tab
- Click on the trash button to delete your brand-new template

### Step 3 – Edit a template
- Click on “Edit” icon next to the demo_template
- It will open a new view composed of:
    - Header: where to save, print and erase last updates
    - Theme: where you can change logo, colors, font characteristics
    - Layouts: to manage blocks in the document
    - Content: to manage data source and visualization of the blocks
    - PDF part: editable when layout is selected. You can drag and drop blocks to change their order, and add or delete page (+/- in the bottom right of pages)
- Change the logo and the colors of the demo_template and save

Congratulations! You now understand how to create a template, what a template is, and how it will be used for your reports. ✅
